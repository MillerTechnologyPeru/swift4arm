## Integration Major Problem
>	* Problem on: __/proc/cpu/aligment__ 
>	* Memory Managment
>	* ARCH build support

## Brief Introduction ##
All began on early 2018 and i was complaining on the fact that swift on arm32 was kinda on a holding status.</br></br>
And i though it's not possible we must do something before it is to late, at this moment we were on the early 
swift 4.1 pre release.</br></br>
At the beginning i tried all different compile setting and i made also some comparison with a x86 linux system
but this was only wasting time. </br></br>
Then i tried all possible llvm/cland version and the same result.</br></br>
After that i made the decision to scan completely the source code and it paid of, i learned so a lot of thinks 
my fortune was to find just at the early stage the solution for the _/proc/cpu/aligment_ problem that
gave me a lot confidence that we donâ€™t take so long for resolving this arm32 issue
but at the end the must challenging part hast just began. </br></br>
## Memory managment ##
the most impostant think in this a kind of project
i started to look at all glibc version since
2.23 and also here scanned the malloc part of the glibc was i rhink i well done
and realy stright forward and the same here a i learned a lot on the internaly memory menagment and i thougth why we must take care of memory alignment when we can deliver this to malloc
I know that here there is room for improvement and so i leased so and i hope we found together a beat solution

then NIO come out and that got me te final motivation to keep fighting.
I know norman maurer from the java community and i thout if he does something like this it must me well done
and it is and what for a hreat opportunity fot such a kind of arm32 bit devices so a lot of ideas come in my mind.
and so finaly i come to this patch release
what ithink is not the ideal solution but the most important think we have now a working enviroment
And finally this great [announcement](https://swift.org/blog/swift-community-hosted-ci/) i was so surprised thank you @chnmrc and always
thank you [steve](https://www.apple.com/stevejobs/)
